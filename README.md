#OpenAR
#Intro
*This project hasn't been officially released yet!*

Here we are going to initiate an affordable AR headset project. We built this prototype with less than 25 euros approximately. But you can have an AR experience with this little money and some DIY skills. You can view objects blended into your real space in 3D. You can augment virtual models on top of markers. And the field of view of our prototype is approximately 41 degree.
